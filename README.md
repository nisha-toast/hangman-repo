# Hangman with ReactJS and Java SpringBoot

This is a work in progress. 

### Steps to run this locally:
1. Download the two folders `backend(java springboot)` and `frontend(reactjs)` into your desired location.
2. Import the backend folder as a Maven Project into a Java IDE (eg Eclipse) of your choice.
3. Import the frontend folder into an IDE compatible with React (eg Visual Studio Code).
4. In the Java IDE, run the project with maven build, using goals: `spring-boot:run`.
5. Switch to the IDE with the opened front end project, run the project in the terminal with `npm run dev`.
6. The game should load on 'http://localhost:8091'.
